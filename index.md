title: Asheville Coders League
---

The Asheville Coders League is a group of coders who
meet regularly on Wednesday nights at the Asheville Brewing Company on
Coxe Ave to share slices and beers.

We also strive to have one technical meetup a month.  Previous
technical meetups include:

* sharing different implementations of [Tic Tac Toe](/tictactoe.html)
* [Ruby to Clojure](http://tcrawley.org/presentations/avl-rb-clojure-intro/)
* [intro to Vert.x](http://tcrawley.org/presentations/vertx-acl/vertx.html) 
* [intro to Scala](/assets/slideshows/AshevilleCodersScalaTalk.pdf)

We are a ployglot group, so if it's a programming language someone is
probably using it.

If you are interested in hanging out with us, feel free to join the
[Google](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/asheville-coders) and
[Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Asheville-Coders-League/) groups, and come out and join us.

title: Asheville Coders League
---

The Asheville Coders League is a group of coders who meet regularly on Wednesday nights at the [Asheville Brewing Company](http://ashevillebrewing.com/) on [Coxe Ave](https://www.google.com/maps?t=m&ll=35.591719000000026%2C-82.555308&q=Asheville+Brewing+Company) to share slices and beers.

We also strive to have one technical meetup a month.  Previous
technical meetups include:

* sharing different implementations of [Tic Tac Toe](/tictactoe.html)
* [Ruby to Clojure](http://tcrawley.org/presentations/avl-rb-clojure-intro/) (HTML)
* [intro to Vert.x](http://tcrawley.org/presentations/vertx-acl/vertx.html) (Slide Show)
* [intro to Scala](/assets/slideshows/AshevilleCodersScalaTalk.pdf) (PDF)

We are a polyglot group, so if it's a programming language someone is
probably using it.

If you are interested in hanging out with us, feel free to join the
[Google](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/asheville-coders) and
[Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Asheville-Coders-League/) groups, and come out and join us.
